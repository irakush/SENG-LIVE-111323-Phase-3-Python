import ipdb

# 1. âœ… Create a condition to check a pet's mood
# If "pet_mood" is "Hungry!", "Rose needs to be fed."
# If "pet_mood" is "Rowdy!", "Rose needs a walk."
# In all other cases, "Rose is all good."

# Note => Feel free to set your own values for "pet_mood" to view various outputs.

#     ipdb.set_trace()  # pause the execution of code
#     # debugger here

#     not_interpreted_yet = "lunch"

elif time == "afternoon":
    print("eat lunch")
elif time == "dinner":
    print("eat dinner")
else:

# 2. âœ… Create a ternary operator using "pet_mood" as a condition:
# If pet_food is "Hungry!" => "Rose needs to be fed."
# In all other cases => "Rose is all good."

# Ternary Operator JS vs Python

# JS
# condition ? ture : false

# Python
# true, if condition else default val

print("eat breakfast") if time == "morning" else print("study python")

# 3. âœ… Create a function (say_hello) that returns the string "Hello, world!"
# Test invocation of "say_hello" in ipdb using "say_hello()"
# say_hello() => "Hello, world!"


def say_hello(param="hello"):  # default argument
    print("hello, world")  # indentation is important

# 4. âœ… Create a function (pet_greeting) that will return a string with interpolated pet's name
# Test invocation of "pet_greeting" in ipdb using "pet_greeting()"
# pet_greeting("Rose") => "Rose says hello!"
# pet_greeting("Spot") => "Spot says hello!"

        print("go to sleep")


print(schedule(time))

# 5. âœ… Move conditional logic from Deliverable 1 into a function (pet_status) so that we may use it with different pets / moods
# Test invocation of "pet_status" in ipdb using "pet_status(pet_name, pet_mood)"
# pet_status("Rose", "Hungry!") => "Rose needs to be fed."
# pet_greeting("Spot", "Rowdy!") => "Spot needs a walk."
# pet_greeting("Bud", "Relaxed") => "Bud is all good."

# Take a moment to note that "pet_name" and "pet_mood" parameters are within Local Scope and take priority over "pet_name" and "pet_mood"
# in Global Scope.

# 6. âœ… Create a function (pet_birthday) that will increment a pet's age up by 1. Use try / except to handle errors.
# If our function is given an incorrect datatype, it should handle the TypeError exception and alert the user
# pet_birthday(10) => "Happy Birthday! Your pet is now 11."
# pet_birthday("oops") => "Type Error Occurred"
